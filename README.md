# Forms in Rails

These projects will use both using nearly-pure HTML and the helper methods that Rails provides. It integrates a signup form and provides help if the user enters incorrect information.

This project includes knowledge of:

- Models, Views, and Controllers (MVC)
- Data Structures & Relationships
- Routing
- Migrations
- Views with forms, partials, and helpers
- RESTful design
- Adding gems for extra features
